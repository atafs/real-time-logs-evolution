## Context: How the Day Started
The day focused on reflecting on financial and personal goals, continuing the job search for senior lead architect roles, and managing stress to improve interview performance, while balancing family commitments and personal routines.

## Experience: Reflection on Financial Goals
- **Details**: You revisited your financial goal of achieving a net income of £9,000/month (£108,000/year), requiring a gross income of ~£181,535. Recognizing the challenge, as current job applications (e.g., £90K roles) fall short, you strategized to aim for a full-time job paying ~£100K+ and ~£60K from side projects to get close (e.g., £140K–£150K gross). Even falling short would significantly improve your finances, covering £3,000/month in London living expenses and freeing up funds for investments.
- **Challenges**: The gap between current job offers and the target income requires career progression and monetizing side projects. Financial pressures from bills and past travel expenses (e.g., trips to India and Thailand) add urgency.
- **Response**: You planned to prioritize 300 Tesla shares as your primary target, halting expensive travel until this is achieved. Additional goals (Tesla fleet, Tesla Bot, time for Fortnite and karate) depend on Tesla’s launches and your income growth. You emphasized simpler living, using your Tesla car for local fun and gaming at home (potentially upgrading to a Switch 2).

## Experience: Managing Stress in Job Search
- **Details**: You identified stress as a barrier in your job search, leading to overdelivering on take-home tests (e.g., overly complex, production-ready code) and oversharing in interviews (e.g., mentioning non-engineering background). These missteps, like missing API header details or leaving logs, cost opportunities.
- **Challenges**: At 45, you face assumptions of 20 years of IT experience, but your varied background can surprise interviewers. Overconfidence and non-standard answers also hinder progress.
- **Response**: You plan to simplify take-home tests, focus on requirements, and give concise, enthusiastic answers in interviews, leveraging your age as experience and highlighting language-agnostic skills from generative AI.

## Experience: Refining Karate Routine
- **Details**: You discussed struggling with World Karate Federation (WKF) training and kumite due to fitness challenges at 45, unable to keep up with teenagers. To address this, you canceled commuter training and competitions to focus on a daily 30-minute karate routine.
- **Challenges**: Fitness drops quickly without daily practice, making intense training unsustainable without a baseline.
- **Response**: You scheduled the routine before dinner, after work, followed by a shower, meal, and part-time work on your pet project. This structure supports fitness progress and aligns with your goal of a balanced, simpler lifestyle.

## What I Learned
- **Realistic Financial Targets**: Aiming for £140K–£150K gross is a practical step toward £181,535, significantly easing financial strain and supporting investments like 300 Tesla shares.
- **Stress Management in Interviews**: Simplifying deliverables and tailoring interview responses to expectations (enthusiasm, standard answers) will improve outcomes. Framing your age and AI skills as strengths is key.
- **Fitness Prioritization**: A daily karate routine is critical for fitness at 45, and canceling intense training ensures sustainable progress.
- **Simplified Lifestyle**: Halting costly travel and focusing on local activities (Tesla drives, gaming) aligns with financial and personal goals, with travel resuming after securing 300 Tesla shares.
- **Next Steps**: Continue job applications, focusing on concise deliverables and interview responses. Work on pet project for potential side income. Maintain daily karate routine before dinner, and limit gaming/travel expenses to prioritize savings for Tesla shares. Prepare for upcoming recruiter and CEO calls next week, leveraging pet project demos.

## Context: How the Day Started
The day began with a technical test for a senior lead architect position, which was a challenging experience due to a mismatch between the test's expectations and your expertise level. You were applying for roles that align with your extensive experience, and this initial test did not reflect the strategic and architectural responsibilities of the position.

## Experience: Technical Test
- **Details**: The technical test involved TypeScript, JavaScript arrays, and algorithms focused on reordering data and adding elements. The interviewers expected you to recall syntax and algorithms by heart, which didn’t align with your current role as a senior architect who leverages tools like generative AI for such tasks.
- **Challenges**: You struggled to write precise code due to not memorizing syntax, attempting pseudo-code instead, which was only partially successful. The interviewers sought detailed explanations of algorithms, which you couldn’t provide on the spot.
- **Response**: Afterward, you sent a polite email thanking the interviewers from Raft.ai, expressing that the test didn’t reflect your operational level, and shared a link to your pet project on GitHub Pages. This link showcased your full architecture, source code, and video demos, demonstrating your high-level capabilities.

## Experience: Conversation with the Manager
- **Preparation**: After the technical test, you had a short break before a managerial interview. During this time, you consulted with Grok to strategize and formulated a question to address the appropriateness of technical tests for your level.
- **Discussion**: In the interview, you tactfully shared your recent test experience, questioning the suitability of low-level coding tests for a senior role. The manager appreciated your perspective and explained that their next test involves reviewing a pull request (PR) and an architectural component—areas where you excel due to your experience at Buildable.ai reviewing PRs.
- **Outcome**: You shared your pet project’s GitHub link with the manager, who was impressed by the detailed documentation and demos. The conversation ended positively, with the manager promising to follow up within 24 hours, despite needing to interview another candidate.

## Context: Continued Interview Day
The day progressed with two additional interviews following the initial technical test and managerial conversation. These included another technical test and an interview with a recruiter, reflecting a busy day of navigating job opportunities while learning from each interaction.

## Experience: Second Technical Test
- **Details**: The second technical test was another low-level coding exercise focused on TypeScript, JavaScript arrays, and algorithms. Similar to the earlier test with Raft.ai, it required recalling syntax and solving problems under time pressure, which didn’t align with your strengths as a senior architect.
- **Challenges**: The test didn’t go well due to its focus on low-level coding, which you find misaligned with the strategic and architectural responsibilities of the roles you’re targeting. You faced difficulties in delivering precise solutions within the allotted time.
- **Response**: You used this experience to refine your approach, taking note of the test’s structure and areas for improvement. This learning directly informed your subsequent interviews, allowing you to better articulate your strengths and concerns about test formats.

## Experience: Interview with a Recruiter
- **Details**: The final interview of the day was with a recruiter, representing a preliminary step before a potential managerial interview for a new opportunity. This role has a streamlined process with only two to three interview stages, indicating a faster hiring timeline.
- **Discussion**: You proactively addressed the issue of low-level technical tests, explaining to the recruiter that such assessments don’t reflect your ability to deliver high-quality work as a senior architect. You highlighted your pet projects, emphasizing their value and relevance to potential employers, and expressed your goal of securing both a full-time and a part-time (20–30 hours/week) role to boost your finances.
- **Outcome**: The recruiter noted your feedback about test formats and appreciated your transparency. The conversation ended positively, with the recruiter indicating that the next steps would follow soon, given the expedited process. You also shared your intent to leverage your pet projects’ value, which could appeal to companies seeking part-time expertise.

## What I Learned
- **Adaptability**: The initial test with Raft.ai highlighted a mismatch in expectations, but you quickly learned to advocate for appropriate evaluation methods, which paid off in the managerial interview. The second technical test reinforced the need to push for assessments that match your expertise.
- **Strategic Communication**: Politely questioning the test format and sharing your pet project demonstrated your expertise and set the stage for a more suitable assessment. This approach was effective with both the manager and the recruiter, helping you align expectations.
- **Self-Reflection**: Past interview experiences taught you to manage anxiety and avoid oversharing, helping you approach this process with more calm and precision. The day’s varied outcomes further honed your ability to learn from setbacks and apply those lessons immediately.
- **Persistence**: You recognized that finding the right role involves a learning curve, and burning some opportunities (like Raft.ai and the second technical test) is part of refining your approach to secure a position where you’re the right fit. Your determination to secure both a full-time and part-time role reflects a clear financial strategy.
- **Financial Motivation**: The urgency to secure two jobs stems from financial pressures, as you’re currently without a paycheck and prefer not to sell your Tesla shares or cryptocurrency investments. This motivates your focus on roles that value your pet projects and architectural expertise.
- **Next Steps**: You plan to prepare for the upcoming PR and architectural test, continue applying for roles on LinkedIn, and maintain a balanced routine with breaks (like eating a sandwich and playing Fortnite) to stay energized. For the part-time role, you’ll target companies that recognize the value of your pet projects, potentially pitching them as ready-to-implement solutions. You’ll also follow up with the recruiter to ensure your concerns about test formats are considered in the next stages.# Daily Log Summary

## Context: How the Day Started
The day began with a focus on advancing your job search for senior lead architect roles, following a busy previous day of interviews. With financial pressures mounting due to upcoming bills and a planned holiday to Thailand in less than two months, you aimed to balance job applications with progress on your pet project to strengthen your portfolio.

## Experience: First Recruiter Call
- **Details**: You had a call with a recruiter representing an initial "stage zero" step in the hiring process for a potential senior architect role. The recruiter shared a few possible job opportunities, indicating interest but no firm commitments yet.
- **Challenges**: As a preliminary stage, the conversation didn’t advance to concrete next steps, requiring patience as you navigate the early phases of the hiring pipeline.
- **Response**: You maintained a positive and professional demeanor, expressing enthusiasm for the opportunities and reiterating your expertise in strategic architecture. You noted the recruiter’s feedback and planned to follow up as needed.

## Experience: Second Recruiter Call
- **Details**: A second recruiter call followed, also at the "stage zero" level, with another company exploring your fit for a senior architect position. Similar to the first call, the recruiter provided details on potential job offers but emphasized that further steps (e.g., managerial interviews) would follow.
- **Challenges**: The lack of immediate progress in both recruiter calls underscored the slow pace of early-stage discussions, which can feel frustrating given your financial urgency.
- **Response**: You highlighted your pet project and its relevance to the roles, positioning it as a valuable asset. You also used the opportunity to reinforce your goal of securing both a full-time and a part-time (20–30 hours/week) role to address financial needs.

## Context: Planning the Rest of the Day
With the recruiter calls completed by late afternoon, you shifted focus to making the day productive by working on your pet project. You also considered taking a break to play Fortnite as a healthy distraction, while remaining mindful of your goal to complete sprint one by tomorrow.

## Experience: Pet Project Progress
- **Details**: You dedicated time to sprint one of your pet project, which is front-end led and aims to enhance the user interface to make it more compelling for potential employers. The current front end is weak, and completing this sprint will significantly improve the project’s presentation.
- **Challenges**: Balancing the urgency to finish sprint one by tomorrow with the temptation to relax (e.g., playing Fortnite) required discipline. The time constraint added pressure to stay focused.
- **Response**: You prioritized project work, planning to allocate specific hours to coding and deferring gaming until key tasks were completed. This approach aligns with your goal of having a polished demo to share with recruiters and managers soon.

## Financial Motivation and Strategy
- **Details**: You reflected on the financial pressures driving your job search, including monthly expenses of approximately £3,000, upcoming bills, and a holiday to Thailand in less than two months. Without a current paycheck, you’re considering dipping into Tesla shares to cover costs, with confidence that two jobs will help you recover quickly.
- **Goals**: Your target is to acquire 300 Tesla shares within six months by securing two jobs (full-time and part-time), which could yield a combined post-tax income of £9,000 per month. This would allow you to save £6,000 monthly after expenses, enabling you to invest in Tesla shares and ensure financial stability.
- **Response**: You remain committed to pushing through technical tests, even if some opportunities don’t pan out, and enhancing your pet project to strengthen your candidacy. This dual focus keeps you motivated despite short-term financial strain.

## What I Learned
- **Patience in Early Stages**: The recruiter calls reinforced that "stage zero" is a slow but necessary part of the process, requiring you to stay proactive without expecting immediate results.
- **Prioritization**: Balancing pet project work with relaxation (like Fortnite) taught you to set clear boundaries to maintain productivity while avoiding burnout.
- **Financial Resilience**: Acknowledging the need to possibly use Tesla shares showed pragmatic thinking, tempered by a clear plan to recover through high-earning roles.
- **Project Value**: Emphasizing your pet project in recruiter discussions highlighted its potential as a differentiator, especially once sprint one enhances the front end.
- **Next Steps**: You plan to complete sprint one by tomorrow, focusing on front-end improvements, and continue engaging with recruiters to move toward managerial interviews. You’ll also prepare for upcoming technical tests, particularly those involving pull requests and architectural components, where you excel. To stay balanced, you’ll schedule short breaks for gaming or other distractions after hitting project milestones.

# Interview Experience Summary

## Timestamp
- **Date and Time**: 03:36 PM BST, Wednesday, June 11, 2025

## Context: How the Day Started
The day began with a technical test for a senior lead architect position, which was a challenging experience due to a mismatch between the test's expectations and your expertise level. You were applying for roles that align with your extensive experience, and this initial test did not reflect the strategic and architectural responsibilities of the position.

## Experience: Technical Test
- **Details**: The technical test involved TypeScript, JavaScript arrays, and algorithms focused on reordering data and adding elements. The interviewers expected you to recall syntax and algorithms by heart, which didn’t align with your current role as a senior architect who leverages tools like generative AI for such tasks.
- **Challenges**: You struggled to write precise code due to not memorizing syntax, attempting pseudo-code instead, which was only partially successful. The interviewers sought detailed explanations of algorithms, which you couldn’t provide on the spot.
- **Response**: Afterward, you sent a polite email thanking the interviewers from Raft.ai, expressing that the test didn’t reflect your operational level, and shared a link to your pet project on GitHub Pages. This link showcased your full architecture, source code, and video demos, demonstrating your high-level capabilities.

## Experience: Conversation with the Manager
- **Preparation**: After the technical test, you had a short break before a managerial interview. During this time, you consulted with Grok to strategize and formulated a question to address the appropriateness of technical tests for your level.
- **Discussion**: In the interview, you tactfully shared your recent test experience, questioning the suitability of low-level coding tests for a senior role. The manager appreciated your perspective and explained that their next test involves reviewing a pull request (PR) and an architectural component—areas where you excel due to your experience at Buildable.ai reviewing PRs.
- **Outcome**: You shared your pet project’s GitHub link with the manager, who was impressed by the detailed documentation and demos. The conversation ended positively, with the manager promising to follow up within 24 hours, despite needing to interview another candidate.

## What I Learned
- **Adaptability**: The initial test with Raft.ai highlighted a mismatch in expectations, but you quickly learned to advocate for appropriate evaluation methods, which paid off in the managerial interview.
- **Strategic Communication**: Politely questioning the test format and sharing your pet project demonstrated your expertise and set the stage for a more suitable assessment.
- **Self-Reflection**: Past interview experiences taught you to manage anxiety and avoid oversharing, helping you approach this process with more calm and precision.
- **Persistence**: You recognized that finding the right role involves a learning curve, and burning some opportunities (like Raft.ai) is part of refining your approach to secure a position where you’re the right fit.
- **Next Steps**: You plan to prepare for the upcoming PR and architectural test, continue applying for roles on LinkedIn, and maintain a balanced routine with breaks (like eating a sandwich and playing Fortnite) to stay energized.

## Combine Markdown Files into a Single Output File

## Purpose
The command `cat *.md > output.txt` is used to concatenate the contents of all Markdown (`.md`) files in the `/docs` directory into a single text file named `output.txt`. This is useful for consolidating documentation, logs, or notes into one file for easier sharing, analysis, or archiving.

## How to Use
1. **Navigate to the `/docs` directory**:
   Ensure you are in the directory containing the Markdown files you want to combine. You can do this by running:
   ```bash
   cd docs
   ```

2. **Run the command**:
   Execute the following command to combine all `.md` files into `output.txt`:
   ```bash
   cat *.md > output.txt
   ```

3. **Check the output**:
   The file `output.txt` will be created (or overwritten if it already exists) in the `/docs` directory, containing the concatenated contents of all `.md` files in the order they are processed.

## Notes
- **File Extension**: The `*.md` wildcard targets all files with the `.md` extension. If you need to include other file types, modify the wildcard (e.g., `*.txt` for text files or `*.*` for all files).
- **Overwrite Warning**: The `>` operator overwrites `output.txt` if it exists. To append instead, use `>>` (e.g., `cat *.md >> output.txt`).
- **Empty Directory**: If no `.md` files exist in the directory, `output.txt` will be created as an empty file or remain unchanged if it already exists.
- **Order of Concatenation**: Files are concatenated in the order returned by the shell's globbing (typically alphabetical), which may vary depending on your system.

## Example
Suppose your `/docs` directory contains:
- `2025-06-11.md`
- `2025-06-12.md`

Running `cat *.md > output.txt` will create `/docs/output.txt` with the contents of `2025-06-11.md` followed by `2025-06-12.md`.
